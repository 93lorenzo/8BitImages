GUI interface made using tkinter to make 8bit images from the one given in input
Python implementation using opencv in order to create the effect
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It works executing the GUI python file that automatically makes work the GUI and then it will call the other methods of the 8Bit file
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The process behind that is to reduce the image in order to create a kind of blurred effect, and then to color substituting for each pixel the closest 8-bit color.
Right now it is a little bit slow due to all the distances it has to perform for each pixel.
